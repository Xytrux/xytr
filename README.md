## xytr editor

A sort of Vim 2.0

## How to run

Simply just run

First, download [this file](https://github.com/Xytrux/xytr/releases/download/xytr/compile.sh)

Next, you want to run it by changing your directory where you put the file.

Then, you can run it:

```
bash compile.sh
```

Finally, just run `xytr <filename>`

I know the download is a bit complicated but i am working on turning it into a linux package for easier downloading.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting (C family only)
- Search features
- And more!
