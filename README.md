## y43

A sort of Vim 2.0

## How to run

Simply just run

First, download `compile.sh` or simply just CTRL + S [This page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xytrux/y43/master/compile.sh).

Next, you want to run it by changing your directory where you put the file.

Then, you can run it:

```
bash compile.sh
```

I know the download is a bit complicated but i am working on turning it into a linux package for easier downloading.
